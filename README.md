# Classification and Prediction: Infection Levels of COVID 19 for Each Country

In this project we classify countries all over the world into levels of infection. Using this, we fit logistic regression and SVM models to our data in order to predict with a high accuracy rate. This can be useful for predicting infection rates of more underdeveloped countries that don't have the infrastructure to record infection rates.

# Models Used

- OVR Logistic Regression
- Multinomial Logistic Regression
- Ordinal Logistic Regression
- Multiclass Logistic Regression with Cross Validation
- Support Vector Machines Radial Basis Function
